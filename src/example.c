For the -nonlinfit command we fit a function of the form 'a+b*exp(-(t-c)^2/(2*d^2))' with the free parameters being a, b, c and d. Two of these parameters, c and d, enter in a nonlinear way into the function and thus must be varied using a nonlinear fitting algorithm. After the function we list these two nonlinear parameters, together with initial guesses for the optimal values and initial step-sizes to use in the search. For 'c' the initial value is '(t1+Dt*0.3)' while the step-size is '(0.1*Dt)'. For 'd' the initial value is '(Dt*0.1)' with a step-size of '(0.1*Dt)'. Obviously for this artificial example we could have simply set the initial values to the values used in creating the artificial signal, but we choose slightly different values to illustrate the search procedure. Because the parameters 'a' and 'b' enter linearly into the model, we can optimize these parameters using linear least squares. We do this by giving the 'linfit' keyword and then listing the two parameters.

Note that this is not meant to illustrate a suggested way to process the light curves (among other problems, ARIMA should not be applied to non-stationary data, like some of the light curves being processed here), but is meant simply to illustrate the use of the -R command in vartools. To run this example you would first need to install the tseries and forecast packages in R, which you can do by running install.packages(\"tseries\") and install.packages(\"forecast\") from within the R interpreter. After reading in the light curve, we issue the -savelc command to save a copy of the input mag vector, which we will want to recover later in the process. ARIMA works on evenly sampled data, so we first bin the light curves in time with the -binlc command, using average binning with a binsize of 0.05 days. We then use the -resample command to resample the light curves onto a uniform time grid (needed to fill in any missing time bins). In the call to R we will input the variables mag and t and output the light curve vector mag_arima, which is created by the R command. The processing command creates a tseries object called mag_ts from the vector mag, which is needed as input to the next routine, auto.arima, which performs the arima modeling, returning the fit object to arima_model. The last command extracts the model residuals from the arima_model object into a vector which is subtracted from the mag vector, with the results stored into the vector mag_arima. This now contains the ARIMA model light curve values. We use the init term to load the tseries and forecast libraries in R before processing any light curves.  The following -resample command resamples the light curve and ARIMA model back onto the original time-base of the light curve using linear interpolation. We then use the -restorelc command to restore the mag vector only to its original form at the first -savelc command. The light curves, containing the columns t, mag and mag_arima are finally output to the directory EXAMPLES/OUTDIR1 with the suffix .arimamodel appended to the name of each light curve.\n\n");

We process light curves in the list EXAMPLES/lc_list_tfa_sr_harm (EXAMPLES/2 is the only light curve in this list). We first use -LS to find the period of the signal. We save a copy of the light curve and then use the -Killharm command followed by the -rms command to determine the amplitude of the signal and the RMS of the residual. We restore the light curve to its initial state (this is needed because -Killharm removes the signal from the light curve when the \"fitonly\" keyword is not used). We then filter the light curve using the -TFA command (no signal-reconstruction; see \"vartools -TFA\" or \"vartools -example -TFA\" for an explanation of the syntax). After applying -TFA we run -Killharm and -rms to determine the amplitude of the signal in the trend-filtered light curve and the RMS of the residual. Note that the amplitude is lower, and the residual RMS is higher after applying -TFA than before applying -TFA. This is because non-reconstructive TFA filters the signal in addition to filtering the noise from the light curve. We restore the light curve to its initial (pre-filtered) state using the -restorelc command, and then apply signal-reconstruction TFA. The syntax for the -TFA_SR command is similar to that for the -TFA command, however this time we choose to output the TFA coefficients and the TFA model to the directory EXAMPLES/OUTDIR1. For the signal-reconstruction specific parameters we set dotfafirst to 0, tfathresh to 0.001 and maxiter to 100 (these parameters only matter if we are using \"decorr\", \"bin\" or \"signal\" which can be used to iteratively fit the signal and filter the light curve, for the \"harm\" mode there is no iteration). We then give the \"harm\" keyword to indicate that we will be using a harmonic series for the signal. We use 0 harmonics and 0 sub-harmonics (only the fundamental is used, i.e. we fit a simple sine-curve). We specify \"period\" to indicate that we wish to fit a period other than the time-span of the light curve, and we specify \"ls\" to have the period taken from the previous -LS command. We output the filtered light curve to the file EXAMPLES/OUTDIR1/2.test_tfa_sr_harm, and we then use the -Killharm and -rms commands to determine the amplitude of the signal after -TFA_SR and the residual RMS. In this case the amplitude is comparable to the value before filtering, but the residual RMS is lower than without filtering.\n\n");

The full 2-d transform will be output to the file EXAMPLES/OUTDIR1/8.wwz, while the maximum Z frequency for each time-shift (i.e. the projection of the wavelet onto the time-shift axis) will be output to the file EXAMPLES/OUTDIR1/8.mwwz.
