In this case the output table will also include \"qingress\" which is the fraction of the transit duration covered by ingress, a value of 0 corresponds to a perfectly box-shaped transit, a value of 0.5 corresponds to a V-shaped transit. The optional keyword \"nobinnedrms\" adjusts the way in which the BLS_SN statistic is calculated. When \"nobinnedrms\" is given the procedure runs faster, but the SN will tend to be suppressed for high significance detections. If this option is given use another parameter (delta chi2 or signal to pink noise) for selecting transits rather than BLS_SN.

      printtostring(&s,"Convert the time system of the light curves. The user must specify \"input\" followed by the input time system (options are \"mjd\" = modified Julian date, \"jd\" = Julian date, \"hjd\" = Helio-centric Julian date, or \"bjd\" = Bary-centric Julian date). The \"bjd\" option is only available if vartools has been linked to the JPL NAIF cspice library (available from http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit_C.html). This program uses the convention MJD~=~JD~-~2400000.5 (Note the 0.5!). Conversions between JD and HJD assume that the observations are made at the Earth-Moon Barycenter, and that this position follows an elliptical orbit about the center of the solar system with linear perturbations to the orbital elements. Differences between BJD and HJD are due mostly to the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn (which are ignored for HJD), and can be as large as 4.2 seconds for observations made between 1980 and 2020. If the input time value has a constant subtracted from it, use the \"inputsubtract\" keyword to specify the constant. For example, if the input time is HJD-2400000, one would give \"input hjd inputsubtract 2400000\". One can optionally specify whether the input JD values have been calculated directly from UTC without accounting for leap-seconds (\"inputsys-utc\", which is the default, and is typically the case if one is using the JD values given in the image headers from most ground-based observatories), or if the time was converted to TDB (barycentric dynamical time, i.e. corrections have been made for leap-seconds) before converting to JD (\"inputsys-tdb\"). In the year 2011 there is approximately a one minute difference between the two systems. The cspice library is necessary to handle TDB. The user must then specify \"output\" followed by the output time system to use. If a constant value should be subtracted from the output times use the \"outputsubtract\" keyword followed by the constant. One may also specify whether the output system should be UTC or TDB based (by default the input system is assumed). If converting to/from HJD or BJD the user must also indicate the source for the RA/DEC coordinates of the target. This can either be \"list\" (in which case the values are taken from the input-list, either from the next available column, or from the user-specified column), \"fix\" followed by the ra and dec values (in degrees) given on the command line, \"expr\" follwed by analytic expressions to evaluate to determine the RA and Dec coordinates, \"perJD expr\" to provide expressions that will evaluate to a different RA and Dec to use for each observation in the light curve, or \"perJD fromlc\" to provide two columns to read the RA and Dec values from the light curve. The epoch may optionally be specified as well, the default is 2000.0. The user may also specify a proper-motion for the target by giving the \"ppm\" keyword and the source for those values. The values are assumed to be in units of mas per year. If for some reason a different radec or ppm was used in determining the input time values (e.g. if the input HJD was calculated for a given image assuming the coordinates of the center of the field, but one wishes to output BJD for the coordinates of a specific star in the field) one may use the \"input-radec\" and \"input-ppm\" keywords. Conversions to/from HJD or BJD assume that the source is infinitely far away and that the observations are made from the surface of the Earth. We do not account for the Shapiro or Einstein time-delays in converting to BJD. See \"Eastman, Siverd, and Gaudi, 2010, PASP, 122, 935\" for an illuminating discussion of time-conversions. Conversions to/from TDB or BJD require JPL NAIF \"kernel\" files which store ancillary time/solar-system data. These include an ephemeris file to determine the position of the Earth with respect to the Solar System Barycenter (e.g. ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/de421.bsp), a leap-second file (e.g. ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/lsk/naif0009.tls or a later one if available), and a planetary physical data file used to determine the location of the observer with respect to the center of the Earth in the J2000.0 inertial frame (e.g. ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/pck/pck00009.tpc). The files can either be specified on the command-line (with the \"ephemfile\" etc. keywords) or one can set environment variables giving the path to these files (the variables are CSPICE_EPHEM_FILE, CSPICE_LEAPSEC_FILE and CSPICE_PLANETDATA_FILE respectively). Finally you may specify the observatory or the latitude/longitude/altitude (or X, Y, Z coordinates relative to the center of the Earth in the J2000 frame) where the observations were made (if not specified, then the center of the Earth is assumed; this can introduce up to a 21 millisecond error in the BJD correction). To specify an observatory provide the \"observatory\" keyword followed by the code for the observatory. To see a list of the codes use \"observatory show-codes\". To give latitude/longitude/altitude values use the \"coords\" keyword, and then either use \"fix\" to specify the values on the command-line, \"list\" to read the values from the input-list, \"expr\" to evaluate analytic expressions provided on the command line to determine the values to use for each light curve, \"fromlc\" to read the values from the indicated columns in the light curves (necessary if one is processing light curves containing data from multiple sites), or \"lcexpr\" to evaluate analytic expressions provided on the command line to determine the values to use for each data point in each light curve. To specify the X/Y/Z values use \"coords xyz\" followed by \"fix\", \"list\", \"expr\", \"fromlc\", or \"lcexpr\".

You can optionally specify a format rule for the output name by giving the \"nameformat\" keyword followed by the formatstring. In that case the output filename will be $outdir/$formatstring with instances of %%s replaced with $inname, instances of %%b replaced with $inname stripped of any final extension, instances of %%d replaced with the light curve number (starting with 1), instances of %%0nd where n is an integer replaced with the formatted light curve number, and instances of %%%% will be replaced with %%. For example, if the second line in the file \"inlist\" is \"tmp/2.lc\", the command \"vartools -l inlist -rms -o ./directory nameformat file%%s%%05d.txt\" would result in copying the file \"tmp/2.lc\" to \"./directory/file2.lc00002.txt\". As another example, if the first line in the file \"inlist\" is \"tmp/2.tmp.lc\", the command \"vartools -l inlist -rms -o ./directory nameformat %b.txt\" would result in copying the file \"tmp/2.tmp.lc\" to \"./directory/2.tmp.txt\". Alternatively you can use the \"namecommand\" keyword to execute a shell command (e.g., sed or awk) to determine the name of the output light curve. Here the command 'echo $fulllcname $outdir $lcnum' will be piped into the command given by the user after the \"namecommand\" keyword, and the name of the light curve will be set to the output of the resulting process. Here $fulllcname is the full name of the input light curve file as read in from the input list, outdir is the output directory specified for this -o command, and lcnum is the light curve number. In the prior example where the second line the file \"inlist\" is \"tmp/2.lc\", the command \"vartools -l inlist -rms -o ./directory namecommand 'gawk '\"'\"'{n = split($1,s1,\"/\"); split(s1[n],s2,\".\"); print $2\"/\"s2[1]\".\"$3\".txt\";}'\"'\"''\" would copy the file \"tmp/2.lc\" to \"./directory/2.2.txt\". If a single light curve is read in, then the parameter given to -o is the name of the output light curve. The \"nameformat\" option and formatstring or \"namecommand\" option and command will be ignored if they are given. If \"-\" is given for outname, then the light curve will be output to stdout. In that case you should also use the -quiet command to avoid mixing the output light curve with the output statistics.\n\nBy default the output light curves will have three columns: time, mag, and err. You can use the \"columnformat\" keyword to change this format. The formatstring is a comma-separated list of variable names to output, optionally using a colon after each variable name to specify the printf format to use for that variable. For example, \"columnformat t:%%.17g,mag:%%.5f,err:%%.5f,xpos:%%.3f\" would output the variables t, mag, err, and xpos using formats %%.17g, %%.5f, %%.5f, and %%.3f respectively. Here xpos is a non-default variable that one would have read-in with the -inputlcformat command. If the light curves are output in fits format, then terms after the colon will be used to specify the units of the column in the light curve header.\n\nBy default a single space character is used to delimit columns when outputing ascii data. You can change the character used for delimiting columns by giving the keyword \"delimiter\" followed by the character to use.\n\nBy default light curves are output in ascii format. Give the keyword \"fits\" to output the light curves in binary fits table format. The output light curve will have the extension \".fits\" appended if it is not already present. Give the keyword \"copyheader\" to copy the primary header from the input light curve (if it was a fits format light curve) to the output fits light curve. Give the keyword \"logcommandline\" to log the vartools command line to the file header. The keyword \"noclobber\" may be used to prevent overwritting any existing files.

Also, if this command is used then one must have as input a light curve list. A total of Ninput_color + Ninput_airmass trends will be searched for. Ninput_color of these will have the colors set initially, Ninput_airmass will have the airmass terms set initially. The initial color terms will be read in as additional columns in the input light curve list, there must be Ninput_color of these columns (by default they will be read starting from the next available column, use the \"column\" keyword to specify the column for the first color term, subsequent terms will be read in order from the following columns). The initial_airmass_file gives a list of the initial airmass trends to use, the first column is JD (or the string-ids for the -matchstringid option) and the subsequent Ninput_airmass columns are the initial airmass trends. As implemented this routine first filters the trends with the airmass terms specified initially and then filters the trends with the color terms specified initially. sigma_clip1 is the sigma clipping used in calculating the mean magnitudes for the light curves. sigma_clip2 is the sigma clipping used in determining whether or not points contribute to the airmass or color terms when doing the fit. Any points with magnitude less than saturation will not contribute. omodel is a flag that is 1 or zero for outputing the model light curves, the output directory is given in model_outdir, the suffix \".sysrem.model\" will be appended to the filename.

The trend light curves can either be white-space delimited ASCII text files, or they can be binary fits tables. You can optionally specify the readformat for the light curves in the trendlist, by default Nskip is 0, jdcol is 1 and magcol is 2. If the trend light curves are in binary fits format you can optionally give the column names (given by the TTYPE keywords in the fits table header) rather than the column numbers for jdcol and/or magcol. Note that if -matchstringid is set then the JDs of the trend light curves are not read-in and instead jdcol corresponds to the column storing the string-ids for point matching between light curves.\n\nUse the optional \"trend_coeff_priors\" keyword to provide a file containing a list of Gaussian priors to apply to the trend coefficients that are optimized by the TFA algorithm. The file should be in white-space-delimited ASCII text format, with three columns: trendname prior_mean_value prior_standard_deviation. The trendname should be the same as it appears for the template in trendlist, while the prior_mean_value and prior_standard_deviation are the Gaussian mean and standard deviations of the prior to assume for that coefficient. Not all trends need to appear in the trend_coeff_prior_file, those not appearing will not have a prior imposed. By default vartools assumes uniform weighting for all points in a light curve which leads to much faster processing when applied to a large collection of light curves. This assumption poses a challenge for handling trend priors. By default all light curve points will be assigned unit weight, while the trend coefficient prior values will have weight 1.0/prior_standard_deviation. If the optional \"use_lc_errors\" keyword is given, then individual light curve points will be weighted by 1.0/err[i] where err[i] is the input light curve uncertainty at time i. This is the correct way to handle the weighting, but leads to much slower processing when applied to large numbers of light curves. If the optional \"weight_by_template_stddev\" keyword is given, then the light curve points will be weighted by 1.0/ave_template_stddev where ave_template_stddev is the average standard deviation of the trend vectors. The processing will not be slowed down in this case, but it only makes sense if the average trend standard deviation is comparable to the uncertainty in the light curve being processed.\n\ndates_file is a file giving all the dates in the second column, the unique string-ids are read-in from the first column if the -matchstringid option is used (it is the same format as the dates file for the ISIS image subtraction program where the first column is the filename and the second is JD).\n\nTrend stars within pixelsep of the light curve in question will not be used in detrending the light curve. To you this routine you need an input light curve list, the x and y positions of each light curve must be given as columns in the list. By default these are the next available columns, use the \"xycol\" keyword to specify the columns.\n\ncorrectlc is a flag that is 0 or 1 indicating whether the light curves passed to the next command should have the tfa applied.\n\nocoeff is a flag to denote whether or not to output the list of coefficients for each trend for a given light curve, if set to 1 then they will be output to coeff_outdir with \".tfa.coeff\" appended to the end of the filename.\n\nomodel is a flag set to 1 or zero that can be used to output the tfa model for the light curve, the output directory is then given in model_outdir, the suffix \".tfa.model\" will be appended to the filename.\n\nIf you use this routine be sure to cite Kovacs, Bakos and Noyes, 2005, MNRAS, 356, 557\n\n");

      printtostring(&s,"Run the Trend Filtering Algorithm in signal reconstruction mode on the light curves (i.e. iteratively filter the light curve and fit a simple signal to the light curve). In addition to the parameters used by the -TFA command, this command allows for simulataneously decorrelating the light curve against additional light curve specific signals. This is useful, for example, if one wishes to do EPD (external parameter decorrelation) and TFA on a high-amplitude variable star. To do this, specify \"decorr\", the iterativeflag is 1 if the decorrelation and the TFA will be done iteratively (this is faster) or 0 if they will be done simultaneously (more correct, but slower). The Nlcterms, lccolumn and lcorder terms are the same as for the -decorr command. Any global signals to decorrelate against should just be included in the TFA trendlist. Other parameters that are different from the -TFA command include: \"dotfafirst\" is a flag that is 0 or 1, if the flag is 1 then TFA will be applied to the input light curve first and the signal will then be determined on the residual in each iteration, if it is 0 then the signal is determined and subtracted from the light curve and TFA is applied to the residual in each iteration. The iterations will stop once the fractional change in the RMS is less than \"tfathresh\" or if the number of iterations reaches \"maxiter\". The model signal is either taken to be the mean value of the binned light curve (specify \"bins\" and then the number of bins to use), it is a fixed signal form read in from a file (specify \"signal\" and then a filename), or it is a Fourier series that is simultaneously fit to the light curve with TFA (specify \"harm\"). If binning is used, then you can specify \"period\" to make the binning phase-binning, and then specify where the period should be read from. If \"list\" is used then the period is read from the input light curve list (by default it is taken from the next available column, use the \"column\" keyword to specify the column), if \"fix\" is used then the period is fixed to the specified period value for all light curves. If \"signal\" is used, then the filename will be a file containing a list of signal files, one file for each light curve, with each signal file containing the signal in the second column. The quantity a*signal + b is fit to the light curve, where a and b are free parameters. If \"harm\" is used, then the signal will be a Fourier series that is fit simultaneously to the light curve with TFA. In this case there is no TFA iteration. Nharm is the number of harmonics in addition to the fundamental to include in the fourier series, Nsubharm is the number of subharmonics. If \"period\" is specified then period for the fourier series will be taken from the specified source. If \"period\" is not specified then the period for the Fourier series will be set to the time-span of the observations.
